  Disturbing Reality in Syria. "Moderate and Not Moderate Terrorists. What's the
  Difference?" Endless war continues with no prospect for peace because
  Washington rejects it - wanting popular Bashar al-Assad forcibly ousted,
  knowing he won't step down voluntarily nor should he. International law
  supports him. Syrians alone may decide who'll lead them, free from foreign
  interference.
